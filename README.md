# Myform

Customer-discovery forms built for founders who need **Mom Test–quality questions**, **fraud-aware responses**, and **real-time collaboration** — without paying to chase bot leads.

Create a project → generate interview questions from ICP + research objective → embed or share a public form → review valid submissions in tables/charts/Excel while fake traffic stays quarantined.

## Methodologies

### 1. Mom Test question generation (Rob Fitzpatrick)

AI questions are constrained to **past instances**, **no product pitching**, and **objective-bound** discovery. Prompt policy lives separately from the Groq transport layer.

- Policy: `lib/ai/mom-test.ts`
- Client / parse / normalize: `lib/ai/groq.ts`
- Prompt ops docs: [`lib/ai/README.md`](./lib/ai/README.md)

### 2. Welford online statistics + z-score fraud

Per-survey completion-time baseline:

- Running mean / M2 on clean submissions
- Rolling window (last 200 times), rebuilt from the window for correctness
- **First 15** clean samples build baseline — **no fake labels**
- Mean / std **refresh every 15** clean samples (not every response)
- From sample **16+**, negative z-score ⇒ flagged fake; stricter reject threshold for extreme outliers
- Hard gates: honeypot, &lt;1.5s completion, absolute time floor, straight-lining entropy

Core: `lib/fraud/*` (`constants.ts`, `welford.ts`, `score-submission.ts`, `process-submission.ts`).

### 3. Operational Transformation (OT) collaboration

Google Docs–style concurrent editing on the **question list** (not character-level CRDT):

- Ops: `insert` · `delete` · `update` · `move` · `replace_all`
- Server transforms client ops against concurrent revisions
- Revision counter + `project_ops` log
- Real-time fan-out via SSE (`/api/collab/.../stream`)

Core: `lib/collab/*`, `hooks/use-question-collab.ts`.

### 4. Free-tier product limits

| Resource | Free cap |
|----------|----------|
| Projects | 2 |
| AI generations | 4 |

Allowlisted accounts are unlimited. Hitting a limit can email an access request (once) when Resend is configured.

`lib/auth/account-limits.ts`, `lib/auth/account-usage.ts`, `lib/email/access-request.ts`.

### 5. Valid vs fake data separation

Flagged / rejected submissions are **excluded** from charts, the primary table, and the Excel “Valid responses” sheet. They remain inspectable under **Flagged fake**.

`lib/projects/submission-filters.ts`.

### Fraud / trust
- Trust tab: baseline readiness, Welford stats, scoring explanations
- Statuses: `insufficient_data` · `normal` · `flagged` · `rejected`
- Trust score + z-score persisted per submission

### Invites & collaboration
- Owner invites by email
- Invitee sees invites on dashboard → Accept / Decline
- Accept grants `project_collaborators` editor access
- Live OT sync + presence while editing questions

## Engineering decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Next.js App Router + Server Actions** | Colocate UI with mutations; keep secrets on the server; simple deploy path (Vercel-friendly). |
| **Drizzle + Neon HTTP** | Typed schema, lightweight serverless Postgres, no always-on connection pooler required for the app process. |
| **Custom auth (bcrypt + jose + sessions table)** | Full control, minimal surface, revocable sessions without adopting a full Auth.js stack for v1. |
| **Prompt / transport split** (`mom-test.ts` vs `groq.ts`) | Question quality is a product policy artifact; model I/O and JSON repair stay replaceable. |
| **Welford + batched mean updates** | Online stats without rewriting history every row; freezing the mean for 15 samples reduces self-contamination and noise. |
| **Z-score as USP after baseline** | First 15 establish peers; labeling before that creates false confidence. Negative z = faster than peers ⇒ fake for this product. |
| **Public submit API hides fraud fields** | Respondents must not learn they were flagged; dashboard is the only inspection surface. |
| **OT for question lists (not full CRDT)** | Small, ordered document; server-authoritative revisions are enough for multiplayer editing without Yjs infrastructure. |
| **SSE for collab fan-out** | Works in a Node Next.js process with cookie auth; acceptable for single-instance / early multiplayer. Multi-region would need shared pub/sub later. |
| **xlsx client export** | No export microservice; founders download immediately from the dashboard. |
| **Imperative SQL migrate scripts** | Fast iteration on Neon without blocking on full Drizzle migration history during product discovery. Prefer `db:generate` / `db:push` for greenfield; scripts under `scripts/` for incremental prod columns. |
| **Zod at boundaries** | Validate public POST bodies and form actions; keep trust boundaries thin. |

npm run test:fraud-accuracy   # print confusion matrix + % metrics
npm run test:ot          # OT transform convergence
```

### What we test

| Suite | Coverage |
|-------|----------|
| **Welford unit** | Online mean/variance matches batch formula; std floor; mean frozen between 15-sample refreshes |
| **Scorer unit** | Baseline unlabeled for first 15; honeypot/instant reject; negative-z flags after baseline; legit ≥ mean stays `normal` |
| **Accuracy eval** | Labeled post-baseline corpus (legit vs fake) → confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 |
| **Hard bots** | Honeypot + &lt;1.5s → 100% reject before and after baseline |
| **OT collab** | Concurrent insert transform; dual-client convergence |
| **Conditional logic** | Branch show/hide, nested ancestors, skipped-path answer pruning |

Harness: `lib/fraud/eval-harness.ts` · report: `npm run test:fraud-accuracy`.

### Fraud detection accuracy (measured)

Evaluation setup (synthetic, deterministic):

1. Build a clean peer baseline (~60s completions, `MIN_SAMPLES + 5`).
2. Score **22 labeled cases** after baseline is ready:
   - **10 legit** — at/above peer mean (careful / slow readers).
   - **12 fake** — below mean speed-runs, honeypot, instant bot, straight-line + fast.
3. Prediction rule: `flagged` \| `rejected` ⇒ fake; `normal` ⇒ legit.

**Latest run (`npm run test:fraud-accuracy`):**

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Cases | 22 |
| True positive (fake caught) | 12 |
| True negative (legit kept) | 10 |
| False positive | 0 |
| False negative | 0 |
| **Accuracy** | **100.0%** |
| **Precision** | **100.0%** |
| **Recall** | **100.0%** |
| **F1** | **100.0%** |

Additional policy checks (also automated):

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| First 15 clean samples never z-labeled fake | **100%** (all `insufficient_data`) |
| Honeypot / instant bot reject (pre + post baseline) | **100%** |
| Full automated suite (`npm test`) | **16+ fraud tests + 2 OT tests passing** |

### How to read these numbers

- This is **offline labeled-corpus accuracy** against the product’s own decision rule (z &lt; 0 after baseline, plus hard bot gates). It is not a claim about every real-world survey population.
- Legit cases are defined as **≥ peer mean** duration; borderline “slightly fast humans” near the mean will be flagged by design (USP: negative z = fake). Tune `Z_THRESHOLD_LOW` in `lib/fraud/constants.ts` if you need a softer cut.
- Re-run after scorer changes: `npm run test:fraud-accuracy` and update this table if metrics move.

### Manual QA checklist

1. Generate questions for a real ICP/objective — score against Mom Test bar (`lib/ai/README.md`).
2. Submit &lt;15 responses — none labeled fake (except honeypot / instant bot).
3. Submit fast outliers after baseline — appear under Flagged fake; excluded from Valid Excel.
4. Invite a second user — both see the project; question edits sync live.
5. Hit free generation / project caps on a non-allowlisted account.
